        "chi" "Kiki:很明显Brand非常想要去搞点成就什么的"
    }

    "Kiki:It is too hard to call you without a name, so let's call you K for now"

        "chi" "Kiki:卡尔,我们做到了"
    }

    "Kiki:Karl... No, it should be 'Dad, welcome back.'"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:卡尔...不,应该是爸爸,欢迎回来"
    }

    "Kiki:Karl... Who is he? I feel like I know him somehow."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:卡尔...他是谁?我感觉好像认识他"
    }

    "Kiki:Look behind you, this core has a security system, pay attention to dodge"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:当心身后,核心是一类安全系统,注意躲开"
    }

    "Kiki:Look, I found a diary"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:看,我找到了一本日记"
    }

    "Kiki:Looks like we have to jump up and touch 8 energy balls to open the door"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:看起来我们得跳起来碰那些能量球才能开门"
    }

    "Kiki:Maybe we won't be able to meet again after this mission is over."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:或许结束以后我们就再也见不到了"
    }

    "Kiki:Never mind"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:别在意"
    }

    "Kiki:No, the facility's security system is activated, which means we are considered the enemy"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:不,设施的保全系统被激活了,我们被当成敌人了"
    }

    "Kiki:Now we go to destroy the portal."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:现在我们去毁掉传送门吧"
    }

    "Kiki:Now we set off to destroy the portal."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:现在准备好开始吧"
    }

    "Kiki:Ok, we successfully started the first core"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:好的,我们成功启动了第一处核心"
    }

    "Kiki:one more, my friend"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:还有一个,兄弟"
    }

    "Kiki:Our way is blocked"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:我们被堵住了"
    }

    "Kiki:quick! Jump into the pipe in the middle and go to the sewers"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:快点!跳进管道到下面那去"
    }

    "Kiki:Quick!we have to start the last core before the countdown ends"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:快点!我们得在倒计时结束前启动最后一个核心"
    }

    "Kiki:Quick, get out of the way! The portal is releasing shockwaves. It doesn't want to be destroyed."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:快躲开!传送门正在释放冲击波,它看来并不想被摧毁"
    }

    "Kiki:Some people's information is scattered here, who could it be?"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:这里刻了一些信息,会是谁呢?"
    }

    "Kiki:Take these core energy sources with you"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:带着这些核心之源"
    }

    "Kiki:That one is distributed by the company, if you lose it I will be penalized"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:那一个被公司分开了,如果你丢了我会被处罚的"
    }

    "Kiki:That's why no one came out to meet us"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:这就是为什么这里根本没人"
    }

    "Kiki:That's why you're here, your mission is to investigate what's going on here"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:这也是你为什么会在这里,你的任务是搞明白这里发生了什么"
    }

    "Kiki:The creatures from the other realm have caught up as well."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:异域来的生物也追上来了"
    }

    "Kiki:The desk is covered with a lot of research materials. It seems that the owner of this office holds a high position."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:桌子上放着大量的研究资料.看起来这里的人所处位置很高"
    }

    "Kiki:The first location is the factory, it looks like we have to activate three cores to close the waste water gate in the middle"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:第一处是工厂,我们得激活核心才能关闭水闸"
    }

    "Kiki:The road here is very difficult to walk, once a group of search teams were wiped out here..."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:路很难走,曾经一组搜查队彻底消失在了这里"
    }

    "Kiki:There is a record of the entire facility, so we can know what happened here"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:有一处有全设施的所有记录,这样我们可以知道这里发生了什么"
    }

    "Kiki:There is no way, we have to break the security system"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:没别的办法了,我们得突破保全系统"
    }

    "Kiki:They say I have more emotions than the average tour guide"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:他们说我的情感水平比向导们的平均值要高"
    }

    "Kiki:This facility is truly remarkable, having such mysterious underground passages."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:这里确实令人注目,有真么多谜一样的地下通道"
    }

    "Kiki:This looks like a warehouse"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:看起来是一处仓库"
    }

    "Kiki:This place is full of smells I don't like, find a way out"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:充满了我不喜欢的味道,快点找路出去吧"
    }

    "Kiki:Though I hold no expectations, there is still not a single person here."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:尽管我毫无期待,这里还是一个人都没有"
    }

    "Kiki:Through this underground passage we can reach the terminal processing facility"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:通过这里我们能到终端处理设施那去"
    }

    "Kiki:Throw them into the core reactor to activate"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:把它们扔进反应堆里,激活核心"
    }

    "Kiki:uh,Although I have heard that the road here is particularly complicated, there is no problem with the brain of the person who designed this, right?"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:虽然已听闻过这里的路很复杂,但是设计它的人脑子真没毛病吗"
    }

    "Kiki:uh.Sorry? Did I talk too much?"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:emm,是我话太多了吗?"
    }

    "Kiki:Wait, hold on. Brand has caught up again."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:等等,Brand又追上来了"
    }

    "Kiki:wait, what happened, the whole room is changing"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:等等,怎么回事,这个房间在变换"
    }

    "Kiki:We just need to toss this mini-bomb into the portal."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:我们只需要把这个小炸弹扔进传送门"
    }

    "Kiki:What is that purple portal on the other side of the door? I've never seen anything like it..."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:门另一边的紫色传送门是什么?我还从来没见过类似的"
    }

    "Kiki:What was that terrifying sound?"
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:什么b动静"
    }

    "Kiki:Who blocked the entrance here? It seems we'll have to find another way out."
    {
        "chi" "Kiki:有人封锁了这里的入口?看来我们得另外找路出去了"
    }

    "Kiki:Whose office is this? It's unexpectedly connected to such a mysterious passage."
