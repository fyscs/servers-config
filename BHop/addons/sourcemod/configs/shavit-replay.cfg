//

// "namestyle" - this is the name style replay bots will use. Including the central bot, as long as it's during playback.
// "centralname" - the central bot's idle name, AKA when nothing is playing.
//
// Variables:
// {map} - current map.
// {style} - the style name.
// {styletag} - the style's tag. See "clantag" in "shavit-styles.cfg".
// {time} - formatted time for the WR currently being played.
// {player} - the name of the player that holds the *record*, might be incorrect for replays from the beta version of bhoptimer.
// {track} - track that the bot replays. Translated from the server's defined language.
// {type} - Replay bot type. Central, Dynamic, and Looping...
